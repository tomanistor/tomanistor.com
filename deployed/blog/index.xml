Syntax Wes Bos and Scott Tolinksi&amp;rsquo;s podcast quickly became my favorite and most listened to web development podcast once it was released. It&amp;rsquo;s the only one on this list that I have listened to in its entirety and new episodes are always at the top of my playlist.
Syntax is more of a JavaScript and front-end development podcast but covers all sorts of topics from website optimization tips, CSS grid, productivity hacks, JavaScript tooling, static site generators, and freelancing.</description></item><item><title>My First Vue.js App</title><link>https://tomanistor.com/blog/my-first-vuejs-app/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2017 13:09:33 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/my-first-vuejs-app/</guid><description>A little while ago, I spent some time researching which frontend JavaScript framework or library I would learn next. The primary criteria was ease of learning, ease of use, and popularity (community support and career usefulness). I chose to start with Vue.js.
My method of learning was by reading the Vue.js documentation and following Ayo Isaiah&amp;rsquo;s tutorial for developing a to-do list application. The former was very helpful in introducing me to concepts and the latter was even more helpful in explaining those concepts in practice.</description></item><item><title>Const, Let, and Var</title><link>https://tomanistor.com/blog/const-let-and-var/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2017 23:21:07 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/const-let-and-var/</guid><description>One of the very first things I noticed when I took up JavaScript ECMAScript 2015, or more commonly known as ES6, were the new types of variable declarations. Whereas I had previously only used var to declare a variable, I could now declare variables using let and const.
But how are let and const different from var? And in what situations are they each appropriate to use?
Scope Each of the the three variable declarations deal with different levels of scope: global, function, and block level scopes.</description></item><item><title>Install and Update Go on Linux</title><link>https://tomanistor.com/blog/install-and-update-go-on-linux/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2017 21:48:33 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/install-and-update-go-on-linux/</guid><description>This is the easiest way to install Google&amp;rsquo;s GoLang (Go programming language) on a Linux machine and then perform an update when a new Go version is released.
Install Go Installing Go is as simple as downloading a binary archive file and extracting the contents in the right location on your machine.
1. Download Go First, visit the Go downloads page and download the binary suitable for your machine.</description></item><item><title>Starting with Vue.js</title><link>https://tomanistor.com/blog/starting-with-vuejs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2017 23:23:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/starting-with-vuejs/</guid><description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little indecisive on which JavaScript framework or library to dive into next. Based on all of the job descriptions I&amp;rsquo;ve been plowing through, any front-end and even most full-stack web development roles require proficiency with a number of different JavaScript frameworks.
Vanilla JavaScript is Not Enough A lot of advice directed at junior web developers that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across online stresses the importance of mastering JavaScript before attempting to level up with frameworks.</description></item><item><title>Cache Bust that Asset</title><link>https://tomanistor.com/blog/cache-bust-that-asset/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2017 13:00:59 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/cache-bust-that-asset/</guid><description>Static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and image files are normally cached for long periods of time with expiry periods of a few weeks or months after being served to a user&amp;rsquo;s web browser. Caching is used to speed up a website or application by once downloading a file and storing a cached version of it in the browser. When a user moves from page to page on a website or revisits the same site in the future, the cached file is served automatically without wasting any time loading the same file.</description></item><item><title>Big List of Free JavaScript Books</title><link>https://tomanistor.com/blog/big-list-of-free-javascript-books/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2017 14:46:09 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/big-list-of-free-javascript-books/</guid><description>This is a big list of free JavaScript books and resources that can all be found online.

Caching and serving static content through dependable CDNs like CloudFlare, MaxCDN, or AWS CloudFront can help speed up your website drastically.
A CDN is essentially a network of geographically dispersed servers. Each CDN node (also called Edge Servers) caches the static content of a site like the images, CSS/JS files and other structural components.</description></item><item><title>Hugo Workflow</title><link>https://tomanistor.com/blog/hugo-workflow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2017 11:32:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/hugo-workflow/</guid><description>The Hugo workflow is fairly simple and straightforward. This is the workflow I use to update and operate this blog and portfolio.
Inside of your Hugo project folder, the public/ folder is generated with all of your static site files once hugo is run in the terminal.
Purge and Serve To generate a new public/ folder, just remove the existing one and run the server. All updates you have made to your content and theme are now available in the new public/ folder and visible on the live server.</description></item><item><title>Hugo Site is Launched</title><link>https://tomanistor.com/blog/hugo-site-is-launched/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2017 02:28:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/hugo-site-is-launched/</guid><description>My new portfolio has officially been launched! This is my first static website built using Hugo. In my previous post, I mapped out a few broad objectives for this project.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the completed goals from a short while ago and review.
Objectives Create portfolio to display work Create blog to jot down my progress and help others along the way Implement design with SCSS Design new Hugo theme and distribute for others to used Create Portfolio The portfolio has been created and published in place of my old portfolio site.</description></item><item><title>Starting with Hugo</title><link>https://tomanistor.com/blog/starting-with-hugo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2017 23:03:31 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://tomanistor.com/blog/starting-with-hugo/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally ditching Wordpress and testing out new waters with Hugo, the static site generator written in Go. Go is a speedy programming language developed by Google.
During this new chapter of my career as a web developer, I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving away from dynamically generated site builders and constructing my new portfolio from the ground up in order to practice and refine my web developing skills with JavaScript, Go, and SCSS.</description></item></channel></rss>
