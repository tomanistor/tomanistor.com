### Summary
Lincoln Property Company is the second largest property management company in the US with over 184,000 units under management. In late 2018, I developed an interactive infographic that presents the current state of consumer trends and behaviors in an easily digestible manner.

The infographic displays digital marketing statistics about sourced from a variety of sources. The information is displayed with eye-catching animations that are initiated by a user's scroll behavior.
