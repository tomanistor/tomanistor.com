### Summary
Morada Plano is a luxury apartment complex located in the Plano Arts District and Historic Downtown Plano. In the summer of 2018, I developed another custom property site for Southern Land Company.

For this build, I implemented new UX features requested by the client and designer like parallax scrolling, SVG animations, counter animations, and an Instagram feed.

### Tools
