      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, on more than one occasion you&amp;rsquo;ve typed out your commit message and noticed a nasty typo after the fact.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick way to amend your last commit message if you have already entered your commit message in the terminal but have not yet pushed your local branch to the remote branch.
$ git commit --amend  This will open up your editor to edit your commit message.</description>

      <title>How to Remove Untracked Files from Git</title>

      <description>Untracked files are files in the git repository&amp;rsquo;s working tree that are not present in the git index. These are new files that were not present in the previous snapshot of the repository.
When you don&amp;rsquo;t want to stage and commit these files, git clean is a useful way to permanently remove all or a selection of your untracked files in git.
This is what untracked files look like when using git status</description>

      <description>One of my recent site builds came back from a round of QA with a bug present only on mobile iOS devices. It was a set of tab links that required two clicks to function on iPhones and iPads.
The Bug The buggy tab links had an effect that added a pseudo element to the right of each link indicating when a link was hovered over, in focus, or active.</description>

      <title>My Favorite Web Development Podcasts</title>

      <description>Around the time I graduated from my programming bootcamp in March 2017, I started listening to programming podcasts to scratch the itch of continuous learning and to keep myself engaged with the world of web development.
Although I started with just a handful, almost a third of my Podcast Addict app is now filled with them. Some are more specific to a programming niche, tech stack, languages, or frameworks while others are broad and all-encompassing.</description>

      <title>My First Vue.js App</title>

      <description>A little while ago, I spent some time researching which frontend JavaScript framework or library I would learn next. The primary criteria was ease of learning, ease of use, and popularity (community support and career usefulness). I chose to start with Vue.js.
My method of learning was by reading the Vue.js documentation and following Ayo Isaiah&amp;rsquo;s tutorial for developing a to-do list application. The former was very helpful in introducing me to concepts and the latter was even more helpful in explaining those concepts in practice.</description>

      <title>Const, Let, and Var</title>

      <description>One of the very first things I noticed when I took up JavaScript ECMAScript 2015, or more commonly known as ES6, were the new types of variable declarations. Whereas I had previously only used var to declare a variable, I could now declare variables using let and const.
But how are let and const different from var? And in what situations are they each appropriate to use?
Scope Each of the the three variable declarations deal with different levels of scope: global, function, and block level scopes.</description>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little indecisive on which JavaScript framework or library to dive into next. Based on all of the job descriptions I&amp;rsquo;ve been plowing through, any front-end and even most full-stack web development roles require proficiency with a number of different JavaScript frameworks.
Vanilla JavaScript is Not Enough A lot of advice directed at junior web developers that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across online stresses the importance of mastering JavaScript before attempting to level up with frameworks.</description>

      <description>Static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and image files are normally cached for long periods of time with expiry periods of a few weeks or months after being served to a user&amp;rsquo;s web browser. Caching is used to speed up a website or application by once downloading a file and storing a cached version of it in the browser. When a user moves from page to page on a website or revisits the same site in the future, the cached file is served automatically without wasting any time loading the same file.</description>

      <description>CloudFlare is a free content delivery network (CDN) that helps deliver static content quickly and efficiently throughout the world. Caching and serving static content through dependable CDNs like CloudFlare, MaxCDN, or AWS CloudFront can help speed up your website drastically.
 A CDN is essentially a network of geographically dispersed servers. Each CDN node (also called Edge Servers) caches the static content of a site like the images, CSS/JS files and other structural components.</description>

      <description>The Hugo workflow is fairly simple and straightforward. This is the workflow I use to update and operate this blog and portfolio.
Inside of your Hugo project folder, the public/ folder is generated with all of your static site files once hugo is run in the terminal.
Purge and Serve To generate a new public/ folder, just remove the existing one and run the server. All updates you have made to your content and theme are now available in the new public/ folder and visible on the live server.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally ditching Wordpress and testing out new waters with Hugo, the static site generator written in Go. Go is a speedy programming language developed by Google.
During this new chapter of my career as a web developer, I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving away from dynamically generated site builders and constructing my new portfolio from the ground up in order to practice and refine my web developing skills with JavaScript, Go, and SCSS.</description>
